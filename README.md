# Project-Templates

Web developments cycle is larger and keeps growing and sometimes we just need templates to get our work done for us without having to use frameworks so we can own the design by efficiently modifying it to our taste with minimal limitations. Hence, this project was inspired to help solve the issue.

PS: We never stop learning. Do more, be more.
